## Developer Achievements  

### Single Factor Backtesting Framework  
This module focuses on creating a robust and efficient framework for testing historical trading strategies using single factors. Key features include:  
- Modular architecture for flexible factor testing, e.g. to accommodate different trading frequencies.
- Support for various performance metrics, including annual returns, maxdrawdown, and Sharpe ratio.  
- Support for plotting curves (e.g. historical return curves).  

Check out the [framework details](./Developer/SingleFactorBacktest/README.md).

### Factor De-stylization Framework  
This framework provides tools to "de-stylize" factors by removing common style influences (e.g., returns, (quote) volume, market cap, closing price). It ensures the purity of the factor and its ability to reflect long-term market characteristics.
Key features include:  
- Outliers Removal.  
- Regression-based de-stylization techniques.

### Multi-Factor Correlation Analysis  
This module focuses on understanding and quantifying correlations between multiple factors, an essential step in building robust multi-factor models. Key features include:  
- Statistical tools for pairwise correlation analysis.  
- Split the dataset into training set and testing set based on the desired timestamp.

Explore the details in the [documentation](./Developer/MultiFactorCorrelation/README.md).

## Researcher Achievements  

### Factor Exploration Based on Research Reports  
Utilized in-depth financial research reports to systematically extract novel factors. Key contributions include:  
- Building a pipeline for transforming qualitative insights into quantitative factors.  
- Testing extracted factors against performance benchmarks in backtesting simulations.  

Detailed steps and examples can be found [here](./Researcher/FactorExploration/README.md).
